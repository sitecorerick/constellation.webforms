============

HttpResponseStatus
------------------
Use these controls to change the HttpResponseStatus of a page. Due to the nature of ASP.NET web requests, it's not a 
good idea to attempt to change the response status anywhere further up the request pipeline if you want to deliver
a custom error experience that requires some intelligence.

HttpResponseStatusNotFound is an example control and can be placed on pages designed to handle 404 conditions.

CompressedViewStatePage
-----------------------
Uses SharpZipLib to compress the ViewState field contents of a page. This is a drop-in replacement for the default
System.Web.Page class and should be used with wild abandon to decrease the size of traditional ASP.NET web pages.
